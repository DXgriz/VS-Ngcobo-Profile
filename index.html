    <h1>Profile Background</h1>
    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p>
      Hi! <br />
      This is Vuyani Ngcobo, a
      <strong>TUT Computer Science graduate</strong> - 2024.<br />
      I am thrilled to have this opportunity to share a bit about myself with
      you.<br /><br />

      I am just a boy from Empangeni, deep rural KZN trying to make a
      contribution to the evolution of technology and simultaneously change
      peoples lives for better, solving their daily problems using the latter.
    </p>

        <h3>My Values</h3>
        <p>
          In life, I find excitement in exploring new possibilities and
          pushing boundaries. Whether its delving into innovative projects or
          embracing unexpected challenges, I believe in the power of
          continuous growth, and I believe in myself and my capabilities.<br /><br />

          I am a technology enthusiast. I am curious and ambitious. Its a side
          of me that adds a dash of creativity and uniqueness to my
          perspective. I have been exposed to various environments in the
          field of ICT, and i have been lucky to be involved with different
          groups of people whom i have learnt a lot from tackling day to day
          problems. I know my career is just starting now, and i am eager to
          learn and share my knowledge and skills and contribute to solving
          problems in the world through ICT.
        </p>

      <div class="row-col">
        <h3>Why ICT or Technology</h3>
        <p>
          So, why Technology?<br />
          Well, its not just about a career opportunity; Its about joining a
          community that resonates with my values. Technology caught my eye
          not only for its impressive track record and reviews from the
          community of alumni. But also for its dynamic approach to focus on
          scarce skills development which i believe is the the breakthrough
          the youth of SA needs in this job competitive economy. I am eager to
          immense myself in this environment and learn from the wealth of
          experiences that technology offers.

      <div class="row-col">
        <h3>Future Aspirations and Career</h2>
          <p>
            As i look towards the future, i am excited about being the best data
            engineer. well, its not just about the job. Data engineering is the
            backbone of data-driven decision-making, transforming raw
            information into valuable insights that drive progress and
            innovation, so its about contributing meaningfully, making positive
            impact and continuously evolving in the ever changing landscape.

    <h1>Educational Background</h1>
    <p>I started attending school in 2003, at UFasimba Primary School, which forms the base which is
      my elementary school education, up until I graduated in 2010 (Grade 7).
      During that stage I had been actively engaging and excelling in most
      academic activities, and extra-mural activities. I have always been a
      hard worker. I then started my high school education at Nomyaca High School
      in 2011 up until 2015 that was my matriculation year. in 2016 I enrolled
      at University of Zululand for a BSC in Applied Mathematics and Mathematics,
      where despite all the efforts I put in my academics, I unfortunately
      dropped out. That was not the end of my journey, through all the difficulties
      I managed to enroll at Tshwane University of Technology (2021) in pursuit of my
      Diploma in Computer Science, which I was able to conquer in record time (2023), with very strong
      academic record. This is NOT the end of my journey, as I am planning to further my studies beyond that.
